# Raspberry Pi Zero W ‚Äì USB OTG Networking & WiFi Switching Guide

This guide explains how to configure USB networking (`usb0`) on a Raspberry Pi Zero W using NetworkManager, so you can stay connected via SSH or a web UI even when switching WiFi networks.

## I had the problem where the otg would stop working if I switched wifi connections. 
## This as I said let's you stay connected to Bjorn if you use http://bjorn.local:8000/ or if you ssh into bjorn with ssh bjorn@bjorn.local

## üß∞ What this setup does

‚úÖ Enables `usb0` OTG networking with static IP  
‚úÖ Allows the Pi to be managed via USB cable  
‚úÖ Keeps USB connection alive during WiFi switches  
‚úÖ Automates setup at boot with a systemd service

## üì¶ Step 1: Create the startup script

type this in the shell.
```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/usb0-setup.sh
```
Paste the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Add usb0 connection if it doesn't already exist
nmcli connection show usb0 >/dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname usb0 con-name usb0 ipv4.addresses 172.20.2.1/24 ipv4.method manual
fi

# Ensure NetworkManager handles usb0
sudo sed -i 's/managed=false/managed=true/' /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

# Restart NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

# Bring up the usb0 connection
sudo nmcli connection up usb0
```

Make it executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/usb0-setup.sh
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Create a systemd service
type this in the shell.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/usb0-setup.service
```

Paste the following:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Configure USB0 Network on Boot
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/usb0-setup.sh
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
---

## üöÄ Step 3: Enable and start the service
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable usb0-setup.service
sudo systemctl start usb0-setup.service
```

## üîÑ Step 4: Reboot and test
Now reboot your Pi:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Or just unplug Bjorn and plug him back in

After reboot, check the connection using:
```bash
nmcli device
```

You should see something like:
```bash
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE      CONNECTION
usb0    ethernet  connected  usb0
```
