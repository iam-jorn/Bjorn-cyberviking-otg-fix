# Raspberry Pi Zero W – USB OTG Networking & WiFi Switching Guide

This guide explains how to configure USB networking (`usb0`) on a Raspberry Pi Zero W using NetworkManager, so you can stay connected via SSH or a web UI even when switching WiFi networks. Useful for CyberViking or other headless setups.

## 🧰 What this setup does

✅ Enables `usb0` OTG networking with static IP  
✅ Allows the Pi to be managed via USB cable  
✅ Keeps USB connection alive during WiFi switches  
✅ Automates setup at boot with a systemd service

## 📦 Step 1: Create the startup script

type this in the shell.
```
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/usb0-setup.sh
```
Paste the following:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Add usb0 connection if it doesn't already exist
nmcli connection show usb0 >/dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname usb0 con-name usb0 ipv4.addresses 172.20.2.1/24 ipv4.method manual
fi

# Ensure NetworkManager handles usb0
sudo sed -i 's/managed=false/managed=true/' /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

# Restart NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

# Bring up the usb0 connection
sudo nmcli connection up usb0
```

Make it executable:

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/usb0-setup.sh
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Create a systemd service
type this in the shell.
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/usb0-setup.service
```

Paste the following:
```
[Unit]
Description=Configure USB0 Network on Boot
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/usb0-setup.sh
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
---

## 🚀 Step 3: Enable and start the service
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable usb0-setup.service
sudo systemctl start usb0-setup.service
```

## 🔄 Step 4: Reboot and test
Now reboot your Pi:
```
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, check the connection using:
```
nmcli device
```

You should see something like:
```
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE      CONNECTION
usb0    ethernet  connected  usb0
```
